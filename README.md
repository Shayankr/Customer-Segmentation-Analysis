# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Mean-Shift algorithms to unveil distinct customer segments based on key features. 
It provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and enhanced customer engagement.

## Key Points:
- Dataset: Mall Customer Dataset
- Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Mean-Shift
- Segmented Clusters


## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mall-customer-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd mall-customer-segmentation
    ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Analysis Highlights
- Clustering Algorithm Used: K-Means
- Number of Clusters: 5

## Results
Based on the K-Means algorithm, the following clusters were identified:
- **Label 0:** People with high annual incomes but low spending scores.
- **Label 1:** Older people with average annual incomes and average spending scores.
- **Label 2:** Young people with low annual incomes but high spending scores.
- **Label 3:** Middle-aged people with low annual incomes and low spending scores.
- **Label 4:** Young people with high annual incomes but high spending scores.


## Future Work
- Explore additional clustering algorithms for comparison.
- Conduct more in-depth feature engineering and analysis.
- Provide visualizations and insights in a more interactive format.
